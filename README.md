CS231n Winter 2016 Solutions
============================

These are my solutions to Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), specifically, the Winter 2016 session.

For those of you going through the course, free to submit an issue if you have problems, questions, suggestions, or would like me to create a 2017 version; I want this repo to help others better understand and work through the course material.

Thanks to Andrej, Justin and the CS231n team for not only putting together such a great course but also for making it openly available.

Also thanks to:
