# CS231n Winter 2016 Solutions

### What is this?
These are my solutions to Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), specifically, the Winter 2016 session.

### Why?
In the spirit of open education. Simply put, I find that having access to supplemental resources, including other people's solutions, improves learning.

### What if I have problems, questions, suggestions, or would like a 2017 version?
Feel free to submit an issue.

### Where can I find the accompanying lecture videos?
On [Andrej's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC).
