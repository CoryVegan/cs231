# There are a lot of files here...what am I looking at?
This assignment contains 3 types of files:
  1. `*.ipynb`: This is where all the assignment problems, as well as most of my solutions, live.
  2. `cs231/`: This is where all the helper python files live. Some of the notebooks require use to modify/implement functions, within this directory, as part of our solution.  
  3. `assignment3.md`: This is the original assignment handout.

# More on each of the ipynbs
The ipynbs are meant to be completed in the following order:
  1. `RNN_Captioning.ipynb`: Implement an **image captioning system** on the **MS-COCO** dataset using vanilla **Recurrent Neural Networks**.
  2. `LSTM_Captioning.ipynb`: Implement an **image captioning system** on the **MS-COCO** dataset using **Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks**.
  3. `ImageGradients.ipynb`: Use a **pretrained model** on the **TinyImageNet** dataset to compute gradients with respect †ø †he image and use them to produce **saliency maps** and **fooling images**.
  4. `ImageGeneration.ipynb`: Use a **pretrained model** on the **TinyImageNet** dataset to generate **class visualizations**, implement **feature inversion** and **DeepDream**.
